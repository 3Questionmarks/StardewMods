"BoxysFall.10": "He ran away...Maybe next time.",
"BoxysFall.11": "Boxy sniffs at your fingers and then gives them a small lick.",
"BoxysFall.12": "Boxy looks better, he's stopped shaking completely.",

"BoxysStory.11": "What should you do?#Give Boxy a soft pat#Shoo Boxy away",
"BoxysStory.12": "Seems to like you though.$1",
"BoxysStory.13": "Hey now, that's real uncivilized.$5",
"BoxysStory.14": "But...No matter how much he likes someone, this kitten just wants to be free.",
"BoxysStory.15": "Boxy makes a noise, it's almost like he's agreeing with Maverick.",
"BoxysStory.16": "Well, I'm turning in. Be careful @.$2",
"BoxysStory.17": "You've a lot to sleep on...",

"BoxysRebellion.11": "#Take Boxy outside.#Leave Boxy alone.#",
"BoxysRebellion.12": "Oh, thank you @...I hope you take the poor thing home with you.$2",
"BoxysRebellion.13": "Boxy isn't ready to be adopted, but at least he let you help him.",
"BoxysRebellion.14": "Okay...",
"BoxysRebellion.15": "I'll try to catch him.$2",
"BoxysRebellion.16": "Caroline struggled to catch Boxy, the entire situation stressed the animal out.",

"KaiaExplains.00": "Could you read it again? I love this story!$1",
"KaiaExplains.01": "Of course I can read it again, but maybe another time. It'll be lunch time very soon.$1",
"KaiaExplains.02": "Hm...Do you think there's a second book? It would be much more interesting to hear how Jumba's adventure continues.$1",
"KaiaExplains.03": "I'm not sure, I'll have to ask a staff member.$1",
"KaiaExplains.04": "Oh, Miss Lesla.#$b#Don't you work here?#$b#Could you help us see if this book has a sequel?$1",

"KaiaExplains.12": "Oh well, I think Captain Go would be much cooler.$1",
"KaiaExplains.13": "I'm so sorry, I can't believe I forgot.$2",
"KaiaExplains.14": "Don't worry about it, sometimes I forget too.$1",
"KaiaExplains.15": "It must be hard; how did you lose your sight?$2",
"KaiaExplains.16": "Say something?",

"KaiaMoms.01": "Sorry Mama.",
"KaiaMoms.02": "It's just really hard keeping it clean-I don't have the motivation.$2",
"KaiaMoms.03": "I understand that, but at least keep the floor reasonable. It's hard finding my way around in here.$3",
"KaiaMoms.04": "You can't just come in here @...$2",
"KaiaMoms.05": "This is why you should clean your room more often, you never know who'll just show up.$3",
"KaiaMoms.06": "Say something?#Nikolai's an adult, you don't need to mother him anymore.#This room is a mess, but it's not your responsibilty, it's Nikolai's.",
"KaiaMoms.07": "What...$2#$b#I...I guess that's true, he isn't my little boy anymore.$2",
"KaiaMoms.08": "I didn't really think of that, I guess if he wants a messy room that's up to him.#$b#But it's difficult for me coming in here, I need a clear floor so I can navigate.",
